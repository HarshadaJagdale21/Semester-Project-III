1. Introduction (18/8/2025 â€“ 30/8/2025)
Problem Statement
Controlling computer systems traditionally requires manual interaction through keyboard and mouse.
This can be time-consuming, less efficient, and difficult for differently-abled users.
An AI-powered speech interface can provide a natural,
hands-free way to control system operations using human voice commands.

Objectives

To design an AI-based interface that recognizes voice commands and controls system applications.
To implement machine learning models for intent classification of commands.
To integrate speech-to-text and text-to-speech for smooth interaction.
To provide real-time, accurate, and efficient system control through voice.

Application of the Project

Hands-free system operation.
Productivity enhancement for professionals and students.
Accessibility support for physically challenged users.
Integration in smart devices and office automation systems.
